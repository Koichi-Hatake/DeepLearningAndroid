# DeepLearningAndroid
This is a sample Android application that uses Neural Network Libraries(https://nnabla.org/).
This is to predict handwritten input of numbers by learning result of MNIST.

## Description
This is the easiest sample Android application to learn first step of machine larning by Neural Network Libraries (https://nnabla.org/).
As in many cases doing so, this application uses MNIST dataset as learning data.
You can create your own neural network easily by Neural Network Console (https://dl.sony.com/ja/), and can verify the neural network performance in this application.
In this case, since this application uses handwritten number as input, you may be able to find weaknesses in your network.

1. Handwriting input
   1. Please input single number(0-9) by handwriting in left rectangle area.
   1. And press ANALYZE button.
1. Get prediction result
   1. Soon after pressing ANALYZE button, converted number image to 28x28 size is shown in left rectangle area. 
   1. And prediction result will be shown in right rectangle area.
   1. Also shown a score for the prediction in bottom of the screen.

## Neural Network
The Network files that generated by Neural Network Console are located in app/src/main/assets/ directory.

### mnist0_9_result_train.nnp
This file has following network.

![mnist_network_00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45664722/50375474-2c74be00-0641-11e9-8422-3ac6868d7cfa.png)

### lenet_010000.nnp
Sample network file.

### To use your own Network file
1. Please add your network file (.nnp) to app/src/main/assets/
1. Change FILE_NNP String object initial value in MainActivity.java.  
   https://github.com/Koichi-Hatake/DeepLearningAndroid/blob/master/app/src/main/java/net/seeeno/deeplearning/MainActivity.java  
   ```private final static String FILE_NNP = "mnist0_9_result_train.nnp";```
1. If you changed network executor name, please update NETWORK_NAME variable as well.  
   ```private final static String NETWORK_NAME = "Executor";```
1. Please rebuild and run!

## Requirement
- Android studio
- C++ utility libraries using Android NDK  
  This git includes pre build libraries, therefore you don't need to build these libraries.  
  If you want to build your own libraries, please refer the site below.  
  https://github.com/sony/nnabla/blob/master/doc/build/build_android.md
  
## Install
1. Download  
   ```$ git clone https://github.com/Koichi-Hatake/DeepLearningAndroid ```  
1. Build  
   Please import by Android Studio.  
   ```File -> Open -> Open File or Project```  
1. Run  
   Run the application.  
   ```Run 'app' ```
