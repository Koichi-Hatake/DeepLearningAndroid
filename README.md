# DeepLearningAndroid
This is a sample Android application that uses Neural Network Libraries(https://nnabla.org/).
This is to predict handwritten input of numbers by learning result of MNIST.

## Description

## Demo

## Neural Network
The Network files that generated by Neural Network Console are located in app/src/main/assets/ directory.

### mnist0_9_result_train.nnp
This file has following network.

### lenet_010000.nnp
Sample network file.

### To use your own Network file
1. Please add your network file (.nnp) to app/src/main/assets/
1. Change FILE_NNP String object initial value in MainActivity.java.
